\section{Academic Backgroud}
\subsection{ Ph. D., \textbf{IIT Bombay}, 2010-Present}
\cvline{}{ Currently working on partition of large scale digital systems. Also
on numerical computation on
FPGAs and many-core architectures, circuit simulation, algorithms in VLSI cad.
My thesis adviser is Prof. Sachin Patkar.}

\subsection{M. Tech., \textit{Microelectronics and VLSI}, \textbf{IIT Bombay} 2007-2009}
\cvline{}{My thesis was on \textbf{Fabrication of micro-electrode arrays for
retinal prosthesis}. My training was in the area of VLSI design and device
engineering. I also took courses on signal processing. My thesis advisor was Prof. Dinesh K. Sharma.}

\subsection{B. Tech., \textit{Instrumentation and Control}, \textbf{Dr. MGR ERI,
Chennai}}
\cvline{}{My project was on \textbf{Stabilization of laser-head in CD-ROM using
PID controllers}. I took various courses on control engineering and developed
algorithms in Matlab.}


\section{Current Skills} \subsection{Theoretical} \cvline{}{\small I am trained
in the area of VLSI, control and instrumentation.  I took a keen interest in
\textbf{algorithms and programming}. Currently I am active in the area of VLSI
cad : synthesis and translation processes; numerical computations on FPGAs and
many-core platforms; and circuit simulations. I have more than layman's interest
in social-anthropology.}

\section{Experience} \vspace{-2mm} \subsection{Working}
\cventry{2009-2010}{Design Engineer, System Admin, Programmer at
\textbf{Kritikal Solutions}}
{\href{http://www.kritikalsolutions.com/}{Noida}}{Uttar Pradesh}{India} {
Development of firmware for movie-cameras on DINI board with RTOS Multi. Image
stabilization using Kalman filtering. Maintenance of version control system and
servers hosted on Solaris OS.}

\subsection{Accademic}
\cvline{2012}{Verilog parser in JAVA : Parsing of verilog to VerilogXML. VerilogXML is
XML representation of Verilog. Two other students have also contributed to the
code.}

\cvline{2013}{Fast matrix inversion on FPGA : Published work. I wrote the algorithm in
C to simulate the algorithm on computer. Verilog design was implemented on FPGA
by first author.}

\cvline{2009}{Circuit simulator : A MNA based circuit simulator implemented in
Scilab.}

\cvline{2012-13}{Teaching assistant system : It is written in PHP/sqlite3. It collects
preferences of department teaching assistants and allot them a job. It uses
Network-flow based method to find a optimal solution.}

\subsection{Other}
\cvline{2007-2013}{Various other projects don are available on my 
\href{https:github.com/dilawar}{github}. Notable among them are
\textbf{code-sniffer} which search the common pattern in codes submitted by
students. Automated system to download and extract the assignments posted by
students on moodle. Python scripts to generate VHDL and verilog test-benches. A
primitive implementation of Binary Decision diagrams. Various algorithms
implemented as teaching assistants are also in public-domain.}

\section{Interests and Hobbies}

\cvline{}{\small I enjoy reading social-anthropology and sociology. I also have
soft corner of Indian history and Indus scripts. If not reading, writing or
coding, I can tolerate going to movies with friends and playing cricket. }
